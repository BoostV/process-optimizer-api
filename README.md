# Process Optimizer REST API #

This project expose a REST based API for ProcessOptimizer 

# How do I get started

If you have Docker installed the API can be started locally by running the script `build-and-run.sh`

Alternatively the project can be build and run with the following commands:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python src/server.py

# TODO

- [ ] Add link to ProcessOptimizer
- [ ] Implement simple API endpoint
- [ ] Define more tasks :)
